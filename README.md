An experiment with sockets to create a multiplayer game

* Based on [Gulp Starter 2.0](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter/tree/2.0)

# Build Process
* Install npm
* ``$ npm install``

# Start Development Server
* ``$ npm start``

# Start Development Server with BrowserSync
* ``$ npm run development``

# TDD With Karma
* ``$ karma start`` - Watches and reruns tests
* Works better than the gulp task which has some kind of bug with ``iconFont``
* Allows you stay in the editor and have all your tests run in the background

# Demo Version
* [Link 4](http://stujo.github.io/javascript-sockets-link4/public/index.html)
